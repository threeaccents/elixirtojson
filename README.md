Transform JSON into embedded schemas!

This is handy when you want to have types/validation for request/response payloads.

# Running locally

To start your Phoenix server:
  * Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:threeaccents/json_to_elixir.git`
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
